🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📘 Overview

This project predicts the resale price of a used car using machine learning techniques.
It leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression algorithms to estimate car prices based on parameters like brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine capacity.

The goal is to create a reliable and transparent price prediction model that helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.

🧠 Features

Cleaned and preprocessed real-world car dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature selection and encoding

Model training using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Model evaluation and performance comparison

User-friendly interface for input and prediction (optional Streamlit app)
